a lot of machines and punch through until they reach Mailen. Mailen doesn't want to be saved by an outlander even though she's injured. At the end Ikrie is unhappy with her current 
situation and feels bad about being a Banuk. She said she would rather live alone and live the life of a hunter. After completing this sidequest you also unlock Ikrie's
challenge which is right next to the Snowchants Hunting Ground.
